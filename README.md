# Food Items Sales Data Analysis In PySpark

In this Jupyter notebook, I have created spark dataframes using Sales data csv files to perform analysis using Spark SQL.

## Overview

### Datasets

1. **menu.csv:**
   - Contains information about the menu items, such as product id, product name, and price.

2. **sales.csv:**
   - Contains information about sales transactions, including product id, customer id ,order date, location, souce order.

## Project Highlights

1. **Conversion to Spark DataFrames:**
   - Utilized PySpark to convert the `menu.csv` and `sales.csv` datasets into Spark DataFrames.

2. **Data Analysis with PySpark:**
   - Employed PySpark's distributed computing capabilities for exploratory data analysis.

3. **Joining and Combining Datasets:**
   - Leveraged PySpark to join the `menu` and `sales` DataFrames based on common keys, creating a unified dataset for comprehensive analysis.

4. **Aggregations and Insights:**
   - Applied PySpark transformations and actions to derive meaningful insights through aggregations and statistical analysis.
